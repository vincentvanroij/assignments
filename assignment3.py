# Before you turn this problem in, make sure everything runs as expected. First, **restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\rightarrow$Run All).
# 
# Make sure you fill in any place that says `YOUR CODE HERE` or "YOUR ANSWER HERE", as well as your name and collaborators below:

# In[1]:


NAME = "Vincent van Roij, #1279190#"

# Fill in the cell above to provide us with your name and student number, like
# 
# NAME = "Adam Smith, #student number#"
# 
# where you replace "#student number#" with your ... (very good!)
# 
# and if you are doing this with someone else (not more than one other person):

# # Assignment 3
# 
# This is the assignment for week 3. This was actually an exam in a previous year. We give the points to give you an idea of how such an exam works. However, we grade assignments only as pass or fail.

# # Bargaining model
# 
# In a previous class we considered a two period bargaining model. Then we extended this to a three period model.
# 
# In this assignment we are going to extend the model to $n$ periods, where $n$ is a variable.
# 
# 
# # Import libraries
# 
# First, we need to import some libraries:

# In[2]:


import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# **1)** [0.5 point] Use `np.arrange` to create a list of offers between 0.0 and 10.0 (including 10.0) with step 0.1:

# In[3]:


offers = np.arange(0.0,10.0,0.1)
raise NotImplementedError()


# **2)** [0.5 point] Introduce the functions `accept_offer` and `make_offer` as in the previous class:

# In[ ]:


def accept_offer(offer,your_outside_option):
    accept = (offer >= your_outside_option)
    return accept

def make_offer(your_outside_option,other_outside_option):
    profits = [(max_offer-offer)*accept_offer(offer,other_outside_option) for offer in offers]
    max_profit = max(profits)
    max_index = profits.index(max_profit)
    if max_profit >= your_outside_option:
        your_offer = offers[max_index]
        your_profit = max_offer-offers[max_index]
        other_profit = offers[max_index]
    else:
        your_offer = -1 # no offer is made
        your_profit = your_outside_option
        other_profit = other_outside_option
    return your_offer, your_profit, other_profit

def accept_offer(_):
    return _
def make_offer(_):
    return _ 
raise NotImplementedError()


# **3)** [0.5 point] Initialize a dictionary `offer` as in the assignment of week 5:

# In[ ]:


offers = np.arange(min_offer,max_offer+0.1,0.1)
raise NotImplementedError()


# **4)** [0.5 point] Complete the following function such that it returns the payoffs to players 1 and 2 for a game of length $n$ periods when the discount factor is given by $\delta$:

# In[ ]:


print(payoff(i, Î´))
raise NotImplementedError()


# **5)** [0.5 point] Check the outcomes for the case where $n=1, 2$ and $n=3$ (these are outcomes that you have seen before).

# In[ ]:


print(payoff(i, ))
raise NotImplementedError()


# **6)** [1 point] Plot for the case with $\delta =0.9$, the payoff for player 1 of a game that lasts for 1 round, a game that lasts for 2 rounds, up till a game that lasts 30 rounds. On the horizontal axis, we have the length of the game; on the vertical axis the payoff to player 1.

# In[ ]:


payoffs = []
for i in range (1,31):
    player1, _ = outcome(i,0.9)
    payoffs[i-1] = player1
    plt.plot(payoffs)
raise NotImplementedError()


# **7)** [0.5 point] What pattern do you see in the graph? What is the intuition/explanation for this?
